- # Identify the problem your web app will solve or the need it will fulfill

  We will represent a web application dedicated to showcasing arts in exhibitions and museums in the form of cards, where each card contains specific information about an art piece. Users will be able to navigate and browse through these cards to enjoy learning about different arts and museums. They can also use it as a source of inspiration to plan future visits to these museums.

 The problem that our web app will solve is the difficulty for art enthusiasts and individuals interested in museums to access and explore comprehensive information about various art pieces and exhibitions from different museums around the world. Currently, gathering such information often involves visiting multiple websites or relying on fragmented sources, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

  Additionally, the app will address the need for credible and reliable information about art pieces and museums. By fetching data from specific APIs and using trusted sources, the app ensures that the information presented to users is accurate and credible, eliminating concerns about the reliability of the data.

  In summary, the web app will solve the problem of scattered and challenging access to information about arts and exhibitions while fulfilling the need for a centralized, user-friendly, and credible platform that allows users to explore and appreciate arts from diverse museums worldwide in one place. Also, to inspire people to embark on exciting and enriching journeys to these museums and exhibitions.
